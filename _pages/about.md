Hi! I'm Sriram, an electrical engineering PhD student at Purdue University. I work as a graduate research assistant in [VIPER Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ips), advised by Prof. [Edward J. Delp](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ace/).

My research focuses on machine learning for multimedia forensics (image and video manipulation detection) and anomaly detection in 1-D time series data (satellite telemetry).

I was a Research Scientist Intern at the Advanced Technology Center (ATC) at Lockheed Martin in Summer 2019.
